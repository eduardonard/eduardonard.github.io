#### Description:
The name is budget checker, and is a web based application.
I learned a lot from projects like finance and birthdays. This app is a personal portfolio manager, you can register and  login. 
Every personal information is hidden, i always used the POST method.
I played a lot with HTML and Javascript, there are multiple windows that are hidden and then can be showed.
Backend wise you can set a cash value, add transactions that can be expenses or income. 
Both have their own categories that can be added or removed from the settings page. 
Obviously the categories change between users. I had lots of problems of mix of data from different users, but I managed to fix all the bugs encountered.
